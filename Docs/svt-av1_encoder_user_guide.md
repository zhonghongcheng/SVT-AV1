## Introduction

This document describes how to use the Scalable Video Technology for AV1 Encoder (SVT-AV1). In particular, this user guide describes how to run the sample application with the respective dynamically linked library.

## Sample Application Guide

This section describes how to run the sample encoder application that uses the SVT-AV1 Encoder library. It describes the input video format, the command line input parameters and the resulting outputs.

### Input Video Format

The SVT-AV1 Encoder supports the following input formats:

_8-bit yuv420p_\
![8-bit yuv420p](8bit_yuv420p.png "8-bit yuv420p")

_10-bit yuv420p10le_\
![10-bit yuv420p10le](10bit_yuv420p.png "10-bit yuv420p10le")

### Compressed 10-bit format

In order to reduce the size of the input original YUV file, the SVT-AV1 Encoder uses a compressed 10-bit format allowing the software to achieve a higher speed and channel density levels. The conversion between the 10-bit yuv420p10le and the compressed 10-bit format is a lossless operation and is performed using the following steps.

#### Unpack the 10-bit picture

This step consists of separating the 10 bit video samples into 8 bit and 2 bit planes so that each 10-bit picture will be represented as two separate pictures as shown in the figure below. As a result of the operation, the 2 least significant bits of the 10 bits will be written into a full byte.

_10-bit yuv420p10le unpacked_\
![10-bit yuv420p10le unpacked](10bit_unpacked.png "10-bit yuv420p10le unpacked")

#### Compress the 2 bit Plane

The unpacking steps separates the 10bits into a group of 8 bits and a group of 2 bits, where the 2 bits are stored in a byte. In this step, every group of consecutive 4 bytes, each containing 2bits from the unpacking step, are compressed into one byte. As a result, each 10bit picture will be represented as two separate pictures as shown in the figure below.

_10-bit yuv420p10le compressed_\
![10-bit yuv420p10le compressed](10bit_packed.png "10-bit yuv420p10le compressed")

#### Unroll the 64x64

Now for a faster read of the samples, every 64x64 block of the 2 bit picture should be written into a one dimensional array. Therefore, the top left 64x64 sample block which is now written into a 16 bytes x 64 bytes after the compression of the 2bit samples, will be written into a 1024 bytes x 1 byte array as shown in the picture below.

### Running the encoder

This section describes how to run the sample encoder application `SvtAv1EncApp.exe` (on Windows\*) or `SvtAv1EncApp` (on Linux\*) from the command line, including descriptions of the most commonly used input parameters and outputs.

The sample application typically takes the following command line parameters:

`-c filename` **[Optional]**

A text file that contains encoder parameters such as input file name, quantization parameter etc. Refer to the comments in the Config/Sample.cfg for specific details. The list of encoder parameters are also listed below. Note that command line parameters take precedence over the parameters included in the configuration file when there is a conflict.

`-i filename` **[Required]**

A YUV file (e.g. 8 bit 4:2:0 planar) containing the video sequence that will be encoded. The dimensions of each image are specified by `–w` and `–h` as indicated below.

`-b filename` **[Optional]**

The resulting encoded bit stream file in binary format. If none specified, no output bit stream will be produced by the encoder.

`-w integer` **[Required]**

The width of each input image in units of picture luma pixels, e.g. 1920

`-h integer` **[Required]**]

The height of each input image in units of picture luma pixels, e.g. 1080

`-n integer` **[Optional]**

The number of frames of the sequence to encode. e.g. 100. If the input frame count is larger than the number of frames in the input video, the encoder will loopback to the first frame when it is done.

`-intra-period integer` **[Optional]**

The intra period defines the interval of frames after which you insert an Intra refresh. It is strongly recommended to use (multiple of 8) -1 the closest to 1 second (e.g. 55, 47, 31, 23 should be used for 60, 50, 30, (24 or 25) respectively). When using closed gop (-irefresh-type 2) add 1 to the value above (e.g. 56 instead of 55).

`-rc integer` **[Optional]**

This token sets the bitrate control encoding mode [1: Variable Bitrate, 0: Constant QP]. When `-rc` is set to 1, it is best to match the `–lad` (lookahead distance described in the next section) parameter to the `-intra-period`. When `–rc` is set to 0, a qp value is expected with the use of the `–q` command line option otherwise a default value is assigned (25).

For example, the following command encodes 100 frames of the YUV video sequence into the bin bit stream file. The picture is 1920 luma pixels wide and 1080 pixels high using the `Sample.cfg` configuration. The QP equals 30 and the md5 checksum is not included in the bit stream.

`SvtAv1EncApp.exe -c Sample.cfg -i CrowdRun\_1920x1080.yuv -w 1920 -h 1080 -n 100 -q 30 -intra-period 31 -b CrowdRun\_1920x1080\_qp30.bin`

It should be noted that not all the encoder parameters present in the `Sample.cfg` can be changed using the command line.

### Sample command lines

Here are some sample encode command lines

#### 1 pass fixed QP at maximum speed from 24fps yuv 1920x1080 input
`SvtAv1EncApp -i input.yuv -w 1920 -h 1080 -fps 24 -rc 0 -q 30 -enc-mode 8 -b output.ivf`

#### 1 pass VBR 10000 Kbps at medium speed from 24fps yuv 1920x1080 input
`SvtAv1EncApp -i input.yuv -w 1920 -h 1080 -fps 24 -rc 2 -tbr 10000 -enc-mode 5 -b output.ivf`

## Appendix A Encoder Parameters

### 1. Thread management parameters

LogicalProcessorNumber (`-lp`) and TargetSocket (`-ss`) parameters are used to management thread affinity on Windows and Ubuntu OS. These are some examples how you use them together.

If LogicalProcessorNumber and TargetSocket are not set, threads are managed by OS thread scheduler.

`SvtAv1EncApp.exe -i in.yuv -w 3840 -h 2160 –lp 40`

If only LogicalProcessorNumber is set, threads run on 40 logical processors. Threads may run on dual sockets if 40 is larger than logical processor number of a socket.

NOTE: On Windows, thread affinity can be set only by group on system with more than 64 logical processors. So, if 40 is larger than logical processor number of a single socket, threads run on all logical processors of both sockets.

`SvtAv1EncApp.exe -i in.yuv -w 3840 -h 2160 –ss 1`

If only TargetSocket is set, threads run on all the logical processors of socket 1.

`SvtAv1EncApp.exe -i in.yuv -w 3840 -h 2160 –lp 20 –ss 0`

If both LogicalProcessorNumber and TargetSocket are set, threads run on 20 logical processors of socket 0. Threads guaranteed to run only on socket 0 if 20 is larger than logical processor number of socket 0.
